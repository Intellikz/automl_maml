# Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning

In this assignment, you are going to implement a very popular meta-learning algorithm for deep neural networks, namely [Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf). 
The algorithm aims to learn a good set of initialization parameters for a base-learner $\pi$

The key idea is summarized in
